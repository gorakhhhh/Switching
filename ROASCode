Router on a Stick:- is a network configuration technique used to allow a single physical router to manage multiple VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) on a network. 
This is achieved by using a single router interface that is configured with subinterfaces, each corresponding to a different VLAN.

-How Router on a Stick Works 
•Single Physical Connection: You have a single physical Ethernet connection between the router and a switch.
•Subinterfaces: The router is configured with multiple logical subinterfaces on that single physical interface. Each subinterface is associated with a different VLAN.
•VLAN Tagging: The switch ports that connect to the router must be configured as "trunk" ports, which means they can carry traffic for multiple VLANs. Each VLAN’s traffic is tagged
  with a unique identifier (VLAN ID).
•Routing: The router performs inter-VLAN routing, meaning it can route traffic between different VLANs because it has interfaces (subinterfaces) in each VLAN.

-Example Scenario:-
Imagine a small office network where there are two VLANs:
•VLAN 10 for HR'S
•VLAN 20 for EMPLOYEES 

-Now, we will make 2 different VLANs on switch namely VLAN 10 and VLAN 20
Switch# enable
Switch# conf t
Switch# vlan 10
Switch# name HR
Switch# vlan 20
Switch# name EMPLOYEE 

-now assign the pc to vlans and connect the switch with router using trunk.
Switch# int fa0/1
Switch# switchport mode access
Switch# switchport access vlan 10
Switch# int fa0/2
Switch# switchport mode access
Switch# switchport access vlan 20
Switch#int fa0/3
Switch#switchport mode trunk

- Now The router’s interface will get divided into 2 sub-interfaces (as there are 2 different VLANs) which will acts as a default gateway to their respective VLANs.
 Then router will perform Inter VLAN Routing and the VLANs will communicate with each other.but before that we will up the gig interface 
r1#en
r1#conf t
r1#int gig0/0/0
r1#no shut 
r1#ex

r1# int gig0/0/0.1
r1# encapsulation dot1q 10
r1# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
r1# int gig0/0/0.2
r1# encapsulation dot1q 20
r1# ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
r1#no shut
r1#ex.
