Virtual local area network(Vlan):-
is a way to segment a physical network into multiple virtual networks. Each VLAN acts as if it is a separate network, even though they may share the same physical hardware.
This allows for better organization, security, and management of network resources.

-Collage Example:

Imagine you are at a college campus where different departments need to share the same physical network infrastructure but keep their communications separate.
The campus network can be divided into several vlans.As u can see in the diagram there are 3 different vlans are created in collage campus.

-Creating vlans on switch:
>enable
hashtag#conf t
hashtag#vlan 10
hashtag#name CS
hashtag#ex
hashtag#vlan 20
hashtag#name IT
hashtag#ex
hashtag#vlan 30
hashtag#name BCOM
hashtag#ex

-We have made VLANs but the most important part is to assign switch ports to the VLANs. 
Switch(config)hashtag#int fa0/0
Switch(config-if)hashtag#switchport mode access
Switch(config-if) hashtag#switchport access Vlan 10

Switch(config)hashtag#int fa0/1
Switch(config-if)hashtag#switchport mode access
Switch(config-if) hashtag#switchport access Vlan 20

Switch(config)hashtag#int fa0/2
Switch(config-if)hashtag#switchport mode access
Switch(config-if) hashtag#switchport access Vlan 30

-After that give the IP ADDRESS to all the pc and ping the pc.
