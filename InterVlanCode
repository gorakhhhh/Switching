-Inter-VLAN routing:- is a process used in networking to allow devices on different VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to communicate with each other.
In inter-vlan we take a layer 3 switch and create a SVI(Switched Virtual Interface) is a virtual interface on a Layer 3 switch that is used to enable routing and
provide Layer 3 IP services for VLANs.

-EXAMPLE:-
Imagine a college with different departments, each with its own VLAN.Each department has its own network needs and security requirements, and
thus, each is placed in a separate VLAN. The network topology might look something like shown in the diagram.

-take a 3560 L-3 switch with 4 PC's
-create 2 VLAN: 
VLAN 10 - For IT Department 
VLAN 11 - For HR
>enable
hashtag#conf t
hashtag#vlan 10
hashtag#name IT
hashtag#ex
hashtag#vlan 11
hashtag#name HR
hashtag#ex

-Now assign the PC's to the Vlans:
VLAN 10 on the switch ports fa0/1- 2
and fa0/3-4 for VLAN 11.

Switch# int range fa0/1-2
Switch# switchport access vlan 10
Switch# int range fa0/3-4
Switch# switchport access vlan 11

-Now create the SVI for vlans:-
-for vlan10:
Switch# ip routing
Switch# int vlan 10
Switch# ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0

-for vlan 11:
Switch# int vlan 11
Switch# ip address 192.168.11.1 255.255.255.0

-now give the Ip address & gateway address to all PC's and go to the command prompt and ping the pc.
