STP(Spanning Tree Protocol):- 
-network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for computer networks using Ethernet bridges (switches).
-The protocol uses an algorithm to determine the best path for traffic, avoiding loops by blocking certain paths.
-important operation of STP is electing the root bridge and determine the best path.
-Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs) are a critical component of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). They are network messages exchanged between switches in a Layer 2 network. BPDUs carry information necessary for switches to perform the operations required by STP, such as electing a Root Bridge, calculating the best paths, and preventing loops in the network.

//STP Process//:
1.Elect the Root Bridge:
-Suppose Switch A has the lowest Bridge ID. It becomes the Root Bridge.

2.Determine the Root Port for Each Switch:
-Switch B will choose the port connected to Switch A as its Root Port because it directly connects to the Root Bridge.
-Switch C will also choose the port connected to Switch A as its Root Port.

3.Determine the Designated Port for Each Segment:
-On the segment between Switch A and Switch B, the port on Switch A is the Designated Port because it is the Root Bridge.
-On the segment between Switch A and Switch C, the port on Switch A is also the Designated Port.

4.Blocking Redundant Paths:
-On the segment between Switch B and Switch C, STP will block one of the ports to prevent a loop. Let's say it blocks the port on Switch C.

5. Final STP Configuration:

Switch A:
-Port to Switch B: Designated Port
-Port to Switch C: Designated Port

Switch B:
-Port to Switch A: Root Port
-Port to Switch C: Designated Port

Switch C:
-Port to Switch A: Root Port
-Port to Switch B: Blocking

With this configuration, STP prevents a loop by blocking the redundant path between Switch B and Switch C.

Command to see which switch is the root bridge:-
>enable 
hashtag#conf t
hashtag#do sh spanning -tree
......this bridge is the root//if this occurs
means it is root bridge so this switch take decision to cut the connection to stop the loop.
